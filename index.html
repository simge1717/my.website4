		Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Simge and I am from ,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRAQ_RC0QM" target="_blank">Adana</a>. I am currently a student at Valencia College pursuing my education in computer programming and analysis. I enjoy learning new technologies and creating something new. In my free time, I like to read, play badminton, and spent time with my family and friends.

		<p>
		My goals include developing strong programming skills and eventually working in the technology industry. I believe that continuous learning is essential in the fast-paced world of technology, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. This webpage represents one of my first steps in learning HTML and web development.
